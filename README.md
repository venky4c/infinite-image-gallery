## Infinite Image Gallery

We'll build an image gallery by pulling images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). We'll load more images as we scroll to the bottom. We also will be able to search Unsplash images.



### React skills used in this app

- useEffect fetches images whenever the *page* variable changes
- **InfiniteScroll** component used for scrolling. NPM library name is *react-infinite-scroll-component*  
- Dynamic url built to support search functionality
- **Unsplash** API used for fetching images
